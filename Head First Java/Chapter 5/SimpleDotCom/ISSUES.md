##ISSUES
*	In the SimpleDotCom.java
	*	You should what do the following statements do.
		>	for(int cell : locationCells){}
		
		>	int guess = Integer.parseInt(stringGuess);

		>   locationCells = locs;

	*	In the process that user select a number and then judge if user hit the DotCom, we could split the process into two part: getting user's input and analyzing user's input, and we have two classes, DotCom and the Game. So try to allocate the task.
*	In the SimpleDotCom.java
	*	Thinking about how could the following statement generate a random number within 0-4.
	
		>   int randomNum = (int)(Math.random() * 5);

	*	What happend in the statement

		>   if(result.equals("kill")){}

	*	In this program, we used an outer class GameHelper to offer the service of getting user's input, can you connect it with the concept of reuse ?
