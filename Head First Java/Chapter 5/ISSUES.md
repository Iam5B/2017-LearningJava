	*	Knowing the rules of the simple mode.
	*	Knowing the meaning of the members and methods in the class SimpleDotCom. Including why we need certain members, and <b>what process in the game will the methods do</b>.
	*	Typing in the class SimpleDotCom accroding to the book and then write the class SimpleDotComTestDrive <b>on your own</b>. Use it to test the class SimpleDotCom.
	*	Typing in the class SimpleDotComGame according to the book(<i>You would have to complete the class.</i>) and learn some language points in it. Then typing in the class GameHelper(<i>You don't have to emphsis on what you don't know in that class.</i>).
