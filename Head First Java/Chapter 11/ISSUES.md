ISSUES
------
*	Knowing the format of throwing a Exception and handling a Exception.
*	Knowing the **types of the MidiEvent** that have been mentioned, and **the meaning of the arguments** in a.setMessage() and new MidiEvent() on page 343 and page 346.
*	Generally recall the process of building a sequence.
*	Generally recall the inheritance hierarchy(层次) existing in the Exception objects (*The root? The common method? A kind of special Exception？*) and the polymorphism when using the Exception objects.
*	In this chapter, we used try/catch to handle the Exception, you can try to modify the code in ./Chapter 11/MIDI to duck it.
