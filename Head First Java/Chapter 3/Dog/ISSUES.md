##ISSUES
*	In the following progress
	>Dog[] myDogs = new Dog[3];
	
	What did we created, Dog instances or remote controls ? 
	</br>
	<i>(Actually it's a process of creating an array.)</i>

*	Could you connect the process of
	>myDogs[2] = dog1;
	</br>
	
	with the concept of deep copy or shallow copy ?
*	Why it's a shallow copy ?
