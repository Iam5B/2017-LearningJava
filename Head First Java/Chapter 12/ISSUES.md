ISSUES
------
*	For the following cases on page 365 to page 367. Generally know the process and what could the Graphics object do is OK.
*	The case on page 371 worths trying.
*	With the help of the concept of the inner class, could you modify the SimpleGui1C.java to make it clearer (SimpleGui1C_Ultimate) ?
*	What do you think is the function of the inner class ?(*In my opinion, it's a way of adding an object as a member, and this object is defined by both given data and the given method. Unlike the method in SimpleGui1B, which mixed two objects and makes it puzzling, nor the method in SimpleGui3C, which makes two object seperated*).
*	If we realize the SimpleAnimation in the way of SimpleGui3C, what problem will we meet.
	*	*Notice the statement in SimpleAnimation*
		>*g.fillOval(x,y,40,40);*
*	In the case MiniMusicPlayer2 on page 390
	*	What's the meaning of the arguements in
		>   sequencer.addControllerEventListener();

	*	Can you compare it with the EventListener in the case SimpleGui1B(*I think these two  process are quite similar*).

*	You can combine the previous code to finish the MiniMusicPlayer3.
