*	Maybe you're confused with the sentence
	>   frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
	
	though it was explained.
	
	You can run the program, and open the **task manager**, then look at the process named 'JAVA(TM) Platform SE binary(32bit)'. Close the window. Repate the process without that sentence and you may feel the difference.
