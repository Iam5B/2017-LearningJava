*	**abstract** means a class could be used after it's extended, it also means that a method could be used after it's covered in subclass (*Notice the way of defining a abstract method*).
*	A abstract method means the class that owns this method would be also abstract.
*	On page 210
	*	Class Object is a parent class of all the class, please summarize the advantages of using the class Object(*Common useful method, polymorphism *).
	*	For the illegal code on the right side of the page, can you understand why (*I think it's because the inheritance is a one-way process, that is to say, if we treat an object from a general view, then we shouldn't force it to do something that is definited from a specific view. For example, we couldn't order an animal to eat bone when we could just know it's an animal*) ?
*	On page 216
	*   Recall how to assign a specific object to a general object and how to assign a *general* object to a specific object. Why could we assign a *general* object to a specific object.
	*   Guess the use of 
		>   o instance of Dog
	
		What about
		>   o instance of Object

		true or false, if you're not sure, you can try it by yourself.

*	Knowing the format of defining a interface and implementing a interface.
*	Interface helps us to realize both multiple inheritance and polymorphism. I suggest that you could try it by yourself to varify it(I used the case on page 226).
*	How did the concept of interface solve the problem on page 223 ?
