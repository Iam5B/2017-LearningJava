* Why the process of producing random number should be
	> (int) (Math.random() * oneLength);


* Math.random() is a function related to class, not an object,can you understand why (Why it's designed in this way)?

	> String phrase = wordListOne[rand1] + "&nbsp;" + wordListTwo[rand2] + "&nbsp;" +wordListThree[rand3];
