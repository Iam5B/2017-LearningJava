##README
*	Here is some code that I think worth typing, along with some issues that might be interesting. I suggest that could you view a chapter first and then read the code and the issues in each chapter.
*	You don't have to seriously read every page of the electric book, as some part of the book, such as filling blanks, connecting task, the swiming pool section are dull actually.
*	Before reading the book, you'd have to learn how to config environment variables(中文:环境变量), for more information, you could search the key word 'JAVA配置环境变量' and '在文件夹内运行命令行' on Baidu.
